### Introduction

* Concurrency control is critical in distributed systems to handle multiple requests accessing shared resources.
* Synchronized blocks can resolve concurrency issues in single-process systems but fail in distributed systems.

### Transaction and Integrity

* **Transactions**: help to achieve consistency by allowing either all or none of the operations to succeed, preventing partial changes to the database.
* Importance of transactions in maintaining database integrity.

### Distributed Concurrency Control

* **Distributed Concurrency Control**: necessary to handle concurrency in distributed systems.
* Two approaches to achieve distributed concurrency control:
    + **Optimistic Concurrency Control**
    + **Pessimistic Concurrency Control**

### Key Concepts

* **Critical Section**: a section of code that accesses a shared resource.
* **Shared Resource**: a resource accessed by multiple processes or threads.
* **Concurrency**: the ability of multiple processes or threads to access shared resources simultaneously.

### Takeaways

* Concurrency control is essential in distributed systems.
* Distributed concurrency control is necessary to handle concurrency in distributed systems.
* Optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control are two approaches to achieve distributed concurrency control.
* Transactions play a crucial role in maintaining database integrity.
