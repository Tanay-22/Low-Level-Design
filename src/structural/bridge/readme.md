## Bridge Design Pattern

### **Definition**
The **Bridge design pattern** decouples an **abstraction** from its **implementation**, allowing both to evolve independently.

### **Problem**
In a tightly coupled system, an abstraction (e.g., `RemoteControl`) is directly dependent on its implementation (e.g., `TV` or `Radio`). This makes it difficult to add new devices or remotes without modifying existing code.

### **Solution**
The **Bridge pattern** introduces an interface (`Device`) to separate the abstraction (`RemoteControl`) from its concrete implementations (`TV`, `Radio`). This enables flexibility by allowing new remote controls and devices to be added independently.

### **Key Components**

| Component              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Abstraction** (`RemoteControl`) | Defines the high-level interface for remote controls. |
| **Implementer** (`Device`) | Defines the interface for device-specific implementations. |
| **Concrete Implementations** (`TV`, `Radio`) | Implement the `Device` interface, providing actual behavior for different devices. |
| **Refined Abstraction** (`AdvancedRemoteControl`) | Extends `RemoteControl`, adding extra features like mute. |

### **How the Bridge Pattern Helps**
| **Without Bridge** | **With Bridge** |
|------------------|----------------|
| `RemoteControl` is tightly coupled to `TV` and `Radio`. | `RemoteControl` and `Device` are independent. |
| Adding a new device requires modifying `RemoteControl`. | New devices can be added without changing `RemoteControl`. |
| Extending remotes (e.g., adding `AdvancedRemoteControl`) is difficult. | New remote types can be introduced easily. |

### **Benefits of the Bridge Pattern**
✔ **Decouples abstraction from implementation** – Remote controls and devices evolve independently.  
✔ **Enhances flexibility and scalability** – New remotes and devices can be added without modifying existing code.  
✔ **Improves maintainability** – Avoids tight coupling and reduces code duplication.
