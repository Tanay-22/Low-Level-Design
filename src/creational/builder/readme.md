### Builder Design Pattern

**Problem Solved by Builder Design Pattern:**

* Handling objects with many optional fields
* Avoiding huge constructors with many parameters
* Reducing the number of constructors
* Resolving compilation errors due to identical constructor signatures

**Key Features of Builder Design Pattern:**

* **Creational Design Pattern**: Helps in the creation of an object
* **Step-by-Step Object Creation Process**: Creates an object step by step, allowing for a flexible and modular object creation process

**Example of Builder Design Pattern:**

* Consider building a house, which is a complex object composed of multiple components (roof, windows, doors, walls)
* Break down the object creation process into smaller, manageable steps (e.g., add roof, add wall, add door)
* Each step returns a mediator object, which represents the current state of the object in progress
* The final step (e.g., "build") returns the fully constructed object

**String Builder Example:**

* String Builder is an example of the Builder design pattern in action
* The String Builder object has methods (e.g., append, delete) that return the mediator object (String Builder) after each step
* The final step (e.g., "build") returns the fully constructed string object

**Benefits of Builder Design Pattern:**

* Reduces the complexity of object creation
* Improves code modularity and flexibility
* Allows for more efficient and effective object creation processes
