### Singleton Design Pattern Notes

The Singleton design pattern is not explicitly discussed in the provided video transcript. However, the concept of a single instance of a class being created and reused throughout the application is mentioned.

*   The video discusses the Prototype design pattern, which involves creating a copy of an existing object, but it does not touch upon the Singleton pattern.
*   The speaker mentions creating a base prototype and cloning it to create different variations, but this is not related to the Singleton pattern.
*   The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

If you're looking for information on the Singleton pattern, here's a brief overview:

**Singleton Pattern Overview**

*   Ensures a class has only one instance.
*   Provides a global point of access to that instance.
*   Typically implemented using a private constructor and a static instance variable.

For example:
```java
public class Singleton 
{
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() 
    {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() 
    {
        if (instance == null) 
        {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
This implementation ensures that only one instance of the `Singleton` class is created, and it provides a global point of access to that instance through the `getInstance()` method.
