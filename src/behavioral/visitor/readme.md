## Visitor Pattern Notes

### Problem Statement

* The visitor pattern solves the problem of adding new operations to an existing class without changing its structure.
* The existing class can grow too large and complex if new operations are added, making it difficult to maintain.

### Key Concepts


* **Element**: An object that can have operations performed on it.
* **Visitor**: An object that performs operations on elements.
* **Double Dispatch**: A technique used by the visitor pattern to separate operations from elements.

### Visitor Pattern Structure

* **Element Interface**: Defines the `accept` method, which takes a visitor object as a parameter.
* **Concrete Element Classes**: Implement the `accept` method and inherit from the `Element` interface.
* **Visitor Interface**: Defines the `visit` method, which takes an element object as a parameter.
* **Concrete Visitor Classes**: Implement the `visit` method for each concrete element class.

### Example

* In the example, the `Room` class is an element, and the `RoomVisitor` class is a visitor.
* The `RoomVisitor` class has concrete visitor classes for each operation, such as `RoomPricingVisitor` and `RoomMaintenanceVisitor`.
* The `Room` class implements the `accept` method, which takes a `RoomVisitor` object as a parameter.
* The `RoomVisitor` class has a `visit` method for each concrete element class, such as `visitSingleRoom`, `visitDoubleRoom`, etc.

### Benefits

* The visitor pattern allows new operations to be added without changing the existing class structure.
* It separates operations from elements, making the code more modular and maintainable.
