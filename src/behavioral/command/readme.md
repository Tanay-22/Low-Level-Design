## Command Design Pattern

The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing or logging of requests, and support for undoable operations.

**Key Components**

1. **Command**: This is the interface or abstract class that defines the `execute()` method, which will be called to perform the requested action.
2. **Concrete Command**: These are classes that implement the `Command` interface. Each concrete command represents a specific request.
3. **Invoker**: This is the object that invokes the `execute()` method on the command object.
4. **Receiver**: This is the object that actually performs the requested action.

**How it Works**

1. The client creates a concrete command object, passing any necessary parameters to the constructor.
2. The client sets the receiver object on the command object, if necessary.
3. The client passes the command object to the invoker.
4. The invoker invokes the `execute()` method on the command object, which calls the corresponding method on the receiver object.

**Benefits**

1. **Parameterization**: The Command pattern allows clients to parameterize the requests they send to the invoker.
2. **Queuing and Logging**: The Command pattern makes it easy to queue or log requests.
3. **Undoable Operations**: The Command pattern supports undoable operations by storing the commands in a queue and replaying them when the user wants to undo an action.
