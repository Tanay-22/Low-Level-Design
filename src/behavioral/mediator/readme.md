## Mediator Design Pattern

### Definition
The Mediator design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encourages loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly. It allows objects to communicate through a mediator object, rather than directly with each other.

### Key Characteristics:

* Loose coupling: Objects do not directly interact with each other.
* Mediator object: Acts as an intermediary between objects.
* Communication: Objects communicate through the mediator object.
* No direct references: Objects do not have explicit references to each other.

### Example: Online Auction System

* **Colleague Interface**: Defines the interface for objects that can participate in the auction (e.g., bidders).
* **Bidder Class**: Implements the Colleague interface and has a reference to the Auction Mediator.
* **Auction Mediator Interface**: Defines the interface for the mediator object.
* **Auction Mediator Class**: Implements the Auction Mediator interface and manages the list of bidders.

### Key Concepts:

* **Colleague**: An object that participates in the auction (e.g., a bidder).
* **Mediator**: The object that manages the communication between colleagues.
* **Notification**: A message sent from one colleague to another through the mediator.
* **Loose Coupling**: The ability of objects to change without affecting other objects.

### Benefits:

* Easier maintenance and modification of the system.
* Improved scalability and flexibility.
* Reduced coupling between objects.

### Real-World Examples:

* Online auction systems.
* Airline management systems.
* Chat applications.
