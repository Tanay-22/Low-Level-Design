## Interpreter Design Pattern

### Overview

* The Interpreter design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to evaluate a given language, such as a mathematical expression, based on a context.
* It belongs to the behavioral pattern category.

### Key Concepts

* **Interpreter**: The way you interpret an expression or language.
* **Abstract Expression**: A way to represent an expression, which can be either a terminal expression or a non-terminal expression.
* **Terminal Expression**: An expression that cannot be further divided.
* **Non-terminal Expression**: An expression that can be further divided into smaller expressions.
* **Context**: The information needed to interpret an expression.

### Components

* **Abstract Expression**: An interface with a method `interpret(context)`.
* **Terminal Expression**: A concrete class that implements the `interpret(context)` method.
* **Non-terminal Expression**: A concrete class that implements the `interpret(context)` method and can further divide the expression into smaller expressions.

### Example

* The example uses a mathematical expression "a + b" as the abstract expression.
* The context is a map that defines the values of "a" and "b".
* The terminal expression is a class that represents a single value, such as "a" or "b".
* The non-terminal expression is a class that represents the mathematical operation "multiply", which takes two expressions as input.

### Code Structure

* The code structure consists of an interface `AbstractExpression` with a method `interpret(context)`.
* The `TerminalExpression` class implements the `interpret(context)` method and returns a value based on the context.
* The `Non-terminalExpression` class implements the `interpret(context)` method and can further divide the expression into smaller expressions.

### Client Code

* The client code creates a context object and sets the values of "a" and "b" in the map.
* The client code creates an instance of the `Non-terminalExpression` class, passing in the left and right expressions.
* The client code calls the `interpret(context)` method on the `Non-terminalExpression` instance, passing in the context object.

### Outcome

* The outcome is the evaluation of the mathematical expression "a + b" based on the context, which returns the value "6".
