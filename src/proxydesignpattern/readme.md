**Proxy Design Pattern Summary**

The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to 
control access to it. A way to access a real object without exposing its details.

**Key Components:**

* **Proxy**: A surrogate or placeholder object that controls access to the real object.
* **Real Object**: The object that the proxy is accessing.
* **Client**: The object that requests access to the real object through the proxy.

**How it Works:**

1. The client requests access to the real object through the proxy.
2. The proxy checks if it has a cached version of the real object.
3. If it does, it returns the cached version.
4. If it doesn't, it creates a new instance of the real object and caches it.
5. The proxy then returns the real object to the client.

**Example Use Cases:**

* Caching: The proxy can cache the real object to reduce the number of requests made to the real object.
* Authentication: The proxy can authenticate the client before allowing access to the real object.
* Logging: The proxy can log requests made to the real object.

**Benefits:**

* Decouples the client from the real object.
* Provides a level of indirection between the client and the real object.
* Can be used to implement caching, authentication, and logging.
